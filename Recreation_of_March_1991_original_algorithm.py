This is a recreation of the computational model from March JG. 1991. Exploration
and Exploitation in Organizational Learning, Organization Science. 2(1):71-87

The code is based on the description from the paper itself (the relevant
quotes are included in the code with a reference to page on which they appear
in the original manuscript), but also on Rodan (2005) and especially the note
by Michael Christensen (2015), both of which describe the missing steps
necessary to recreate Figure 1 from the original paper. Attempting recreation
of the model from the 1991 paper alone is not possible as the original
text misses some important information. I provided specific notes in those
places where the original code differs from the paper.

The objective of this exercise was to reproduce Figure 1, but the code
can also be used to reproduce additional results from the paper, like
impact of employee turnover or environmental turbulence.

The code has been tested on Anaconda Python 3.7

        of individuals, even while it is being affected by those
        beliefs. The beliefs of individuals do not affect the beliefs of
        other individuals directly but only through affecting the
        code. The effects of reality are also indirect.  Neither the
        individuals nor the organizations experience reality.

            "(3) Individuals modify their beliefs continuously as a
            consequence of socialization into the organization and education
            into its code of beliefs. Specifically, if the code is 0 on a
            particular dimension, individual belief is not affected. In each
            period in which the code differs on any particular dimension from
            the belief of an individual, individual belief changes to that of
            the code with probability, p1. Thus, p1 is a parameter reflecting
            the effectiveness of socialization, i.e., learning from the code.
            Changes on the several dimensions are assumed to be independent
            of each other." March 1991: 74
            
            "Socialization gives each component of each agentâ€™s beliefs a
            chance (p1) to align with the organizational code if the code
            on the particular dimension is nonzero. If an agent changes a
            certain belief, the change is gradual or in steps, in the sense
            that a value of zero agent belief will align completely with
            the organizational code whereas an agent belief completely
            misaligned with the organizational code will turn zero. The
            gradual change allows agents to return to the experimenting
            phase." Christensen 2015: 4
            
            This last point that individuals socialize gradually is very
            important. Without it the results will look like Figure 1, but
            the values will not match exactly.

            "(4) At the same time, the organizational code adapts to the
            beliefs of those individuals whose beliefs correspond with
            reality on more dimensions than does the code. The probability
            that the beliefs of the code will be adjusted to conform to the
            dominant belief within the superior group on any particular
            dimension depends on the level of agreement among individuals in
            the superior group and on p2.1 Thus, P2 is a parameter reflecting

            Note: here is where the paper departs from the code used for the
            1991 paper. Instead of looking at the knowledge of individuals,
            the organization observes actual outcomes of actions and actions
            themselves individuals take and compares it to its own knowledge.
            Here the organization doesn't look at its own performance but simply
            at on how many dimensions it is correct about reality.

            # Now the code is learning from the superior individuals
            '''
            "More precisely, if the code is the same as the majority
            view among those individuals whose overall knowledge score is
            superior to that of the code, the code remains unchanged. If
            the code differs from the majority view on a particular dimension
            at the start of a time period, the probability that it will be
            unchanged at the end of period is (1 - P2)^k, where k (k > 0) is
            the number of individuals (within the superior group) who differ
            from the code on this dimension minus the number who do not.
            This formulation makes the effective rate of code learning
            dependent on k, which probably depends on n. In the present
